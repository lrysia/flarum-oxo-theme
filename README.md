A Flarum Theme. OXO Theme  
Card-style themes, with a few little mockups,  
It's been 620 days since the style was published, and finally the theme Ext. was recently reorganized and optimized,  
The frosted glass effect used on the theme was abandoned because it needed to be matched with a nice Bg~  XP


- Support `FoF Night Mode`、`Achievements`、`Level Ranks`、`Blog`、`Signature` and so on...

There may be some bugs. If you find it, please remind me, and I will fix it in time!
